In the previous part, you learned to define simulations, which have their own
state.  The state of a simulation could be as simple as one number, but grew to
tuples with several components.  As you define more capable simulations, keeping
track of all the parts of a tuple begins to get very tedious.  We need a better
way to organize our simulations.

Top-down decomposition was an invaluable tool in organizing complicated
drawings.  You can do the same with state.  Instead of thinking of complex state
as a huge collection of simple types like numbers, you will strive to think of
your state as a having just a few pieces, each of which is meaningful and has
its own structure.
