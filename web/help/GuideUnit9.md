What is Modeling?
=================

Modeling refers to using mathematical structures, such as functions and
equations, to represent a real-world process or system.  Models are used
to explore lots of systems using mathematical rules.  Scientists use models
to predict the effects of different weather patterns.  Engineers use
modeling to decide how well a plane will fly.  Banks use models to make
choices in how to invest, and predict how much money they can make from
different investments.

In this section, we'll explore using your CodeWorld skills for various
modeling tasks.
