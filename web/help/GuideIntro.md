Welcome to CodeWorld!
=====================

CodeWorld is an environment where you can build create drawings, animations, and even
single-player and multi-player video games using mathematics, using shapes, colors and
transformations.  It's programming a computer with mathematics.

This is the *CodeWorld Guide*, to help get you started.  The guide is organized into parts,
which you can choose on the left.  Click *outside* the guide to start working.  But
don't worry: the **Guide** button at the bottom of the screen will get you back here.

How to be successful
====================

Before you get started, let's talk about some strategies to be successful.

1. **Try everything!** You can't learn computer programming by reading about it.
   When you *wonder* what will happen if you try something, just try it!  If you
   think you understand, prove it to yourself!

   Many of the examples in this guide can be copied into the CodeWorld editor and run as
   is! If you see a blue box, you can click it to copy the code and try it out.

2. **Value your mistakes!** You might have heard that mistakes prove you are
   learning. That's even more true of computer programming. Even the best programmers
   don't usually get it right the first time, so don't try to avoid making mistakes.
   Instead, learn to understand and fix your mistakes more easily.

3. **Have fun!** Programming can be difficult, but it doesn't have to be boring. Let
   yourself have some fun, share your creations with friends and family, and most of
   all, laugh.

To get some cool ideas about what you can do in CodeWorld, you might want to check
out the [CodeWorld Gallery](/gallery.html), with examples of projects built by
other students.  Don't worry if you aren't that advanced yet.  It takes patience,
but you can get there, too!

The CodeWorld environment
=========================

Before you start writing your own code, here's a quick tour of the tools you have.

You'll type your code in the **editor**, which is right behind this guide.  To get
to the editor, click *outside* of the guide to get rid of it.  Don't worry; the
guide is right here waiting for you by pressing the **Guide** button.

It's important to save your work.  To do that, click the **Sign In** button.  Once
you're signed in, you will see the **project browser** on the left.  Use it to save
your projects, and load any projects you've saved earlier.

!!! Warning: Save your work!
    It's easy to work hard on a project, but forget to save it.  You could lose all
    that work!  Get in the habit of saving your program often.

To try your programs, click the **Run** button, at the bottom right corner of the
screen.  Your program will run in the **canvas**, at the top-right corner of the
screen.  Don't worry! Nothing you do in CodeWorld can harm your computer.

Beneath the canvas, the **message** area will show you any messages about
your program.  These could be *errors*, explaining what your computer doesn't
understand about your code.  They could be *warnings*, making a suggestion for
improving your code.  Or they could be *trace* messaged, that you can add
yourself to help understand what your program is doing.

If there's a problem with your code, the message window will turn a light red,
or pink, color.  When this happens, it's okay!  Just read the message that
explains what is wrong, and then double-check your code.
