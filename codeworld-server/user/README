This directory contains user code compiled by CodeWorld.  Files are named after
an MD5 hash of the source code, with the following three extensions:

  .hs    - Contains original source code
  .jsexe - Directory with JavaScript output for a successful compile
  .err   - Contains plain text compiler errors, for unsuccessful compile

Note that CodeWorld will not try to recompile source code that's already
included in this directory, so if something like the libraries changes, then
the .js and .err files in this directory should be deleted.
