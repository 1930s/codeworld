## The list

* Little School on Vermijo
  * LSV piloted an introductory programming class for 6 to 8 students grades 6 through 8.  This was the original CodeWorld class.  It began in the 2011-2012 school year, ran again in abbreviated form in the Spring of 2015, and then for the 2015-2016 school year.  Classes were co-taught by Chris Smith and Sue Spengler.

  * A class of more than 30 girls in grades 6 through 8 met weekly before school at Graham Middle School for the Spring semester, 2016 organized by [Empoder](http://www.empoder.org).  They were taught by Brooklyn Cook from Graham Middle School, and mentored by volunteers from Google, Apple, GoDaddy, and LinkedIn.
* Hillview Middle School, Fall 2014
  * Luke Palmer used CodeWorld for the introductory section of a computer science class at Hillview Middle School.
