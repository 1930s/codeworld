How to contribute
=================

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.  There is
just one thing you need to do first.

Contributions must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. This is
*not* a copyright assignment.  It simply gives permission to Google to use and
redistribute your contributions.

If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own
the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
[individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).

If you work for a company that allows you to contribute your work, then you'll
need to sign a
[corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

You generally only need to submit a CLA to Google once, so if you've already
submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't
need to do it again.
